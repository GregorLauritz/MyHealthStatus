/**
 * Task 5: after a [LocalRestoreManager] restore commits (and, when preferences restore itself
 * succeeds, after that too -- see the caller), decides whether the restored `daily_summaries` rows
 * need a local workout-recommendation backfill.
 *
 * Deliberately checked against the restored rows themselves via [WorkoutRecommendationCodec] --
 * never against the restored `scoringVersion` preference, which a backup can carry incorrectly
 * (e.g. it predates a rule-version bump the restored `scoringVersion` doesn't reflect). This is a
 * genuine "is the data there" check, not a "does the label claim it's there" check.
 *
 * The test is *no* retained row carries a payload, i.e. the restored database predates the feature
 * entirely -- deliberately not "some row is missing one". A per-row test cannot distinguish "never
 * computed" from "computed and legitimately produced nothing" (a day whose morning sleep-metrics
 * pass fails always will, for the same stored data), so it would make every restore of such a
 * database schedule another full recompute that can never change the outcome. The narrower test
 * costs only the partially-covered-restore case, and that one still converges: a partially covered
 * database was left behind by an interrupted backfill, so its `scoringVersion` is still stale and
 * [app.readylytics.health.DatabaseReadyStartupInitializer]'s version gate re-enqueues the same
 * recompute on the next launch.
 *
 * Bounded to *retained* rows (per the brief's "retained-summary coverage checks"): a row outside
 * `RetentionBounds.resolveRetentionCutoffMs` can never be repaired by the retention-bounded
 * recompute this schedules anyway, so it must never be the reason a restore triggers one. Reads
 * preferences fresh at call time so it reflects whatever this restore actually left behind --
 * newly restored preferences on the success path, or the untouched pre-restore preferences on the
 * path where preferences restore itself failed. An empty (or fully outside-retention) backup has
 * nothing to backfill.
 *
 * Best-effort and never fails the restore that already succeeded: worst case, the next launch's
 * startup gate or a later manual resync converges it through the same
 * [app.readylytics.health.core.model.data.preferences.SettingsDefaults.CURRENT_SCORING_VERSION]
 * marker as the normal upgrade path.
