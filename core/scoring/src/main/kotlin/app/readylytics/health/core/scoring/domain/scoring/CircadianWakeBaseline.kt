/**
 * Shared baseline-selection and median routine behind the user's "usual" bedtime and wake time.
 *
 * Extracted from [CircadianConsistencyRepository] so the circadian consistency score and the
 * morning workout-recommendation anchor derive the same habitual clock times from the same rules:
 * naps shorter than [NAP_THRESHOLD_MINUTES] never count, the most recent `baselineCount` qualifying
 * sessions form the baseline, and fewer than [MIN_BASELINE_SESSIONS] of them means *no* baseline
 * rather than a substituted default.
 *
 * Callers control the history that is offered. [CircadianConsistencyRepository] passes everything
 * before its own anchor; the recommendation anchor passes only sessions ending before the target
 * date starts, so the day being scored can never define its own "usual" wake time.
